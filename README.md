# Custom Spinner 2

After Implementing The Original Custom Spinner with Plain Javascript,
I found that reusable Components could also be implemented by following the WebComponents approach,using Plain Javascript and some polyfills 

The Four Pillars of Web Components:

1- Custom Elements

2- HTML Templates

3- Shadow DOM

4- HTML Imports

so here, you will find another implementation of my Spinner follwing the WebComponents approach

## Setup
```
npm install
```

## Start
```
npm start
```
